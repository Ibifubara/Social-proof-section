# Frontend mentor- Social Proof Section solution
- This is a solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA).

## Overview

### The challenge
 Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  
### My process:
- The first thing I did was to study the design templates provided alongside the challenge and tried to understand what was required in the challenge. Through that, I was able to come up with a plan on how to go about it.

### Built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
